Throughout my learning journey with HTML and CSS, I gained a general sense of the process of constructing and styling websites. I learned that HTML constructs the content of the website, and I learned how to structure that content with elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and tables. I learned the different ways to optimize my content for better accessibility and better readability inline. The hands-on projects gave me opportunities to gain experience building multi-page websites and remembering to nest my elements correctly, as well as how to connect my internal pages as well as external pages. CSS added a layer of design to my learning that allowed me to style my HTML elements based on color, font style, spacing, layout, and transitions. I gained experience with the box model and margins and padding, and how Flexbox helps shape layout. I learned how to write external stylesheets and how to take advantage of classes and IDs properly, and how to use hover and media-query for responsive design. I realized a great user experience is developed by the way structure and design to create something functional but also engaging. Overall, I came away from this learning experience a keener coder and more confident about how websites are built in the real world; I am now ready to take benchmarks towards more complex web development projects.
